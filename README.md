Hello! My name is Ivan Mak and I am a recent graduate of mechatronics engineering at Ontario Tech University. As a mechatronics student, I have been exposed to projects that deal with mechanical, electrical, and software design. The world of robotics has always fascinated me and witnessing the different innovative technologies in industries around the world is what motivates me to learn and create my robotics applications/platforms. I want to be a part of the community of robotics engineers who continue to re-design technologies that make a difference.
